Good luck!

## 2. K-means clustering

**Question 1**: How did you initialize the clustering process and why do you believe this was a good method of doing it? 

**Answers:**



---

**Question 2**: How many iterations L do you typically need to reach convergence, that is the point where no additional iterations will affect the end results? 

**Answers:**



---

**Question 3**: What is the minimum value for K that you can use and still get no superpixel that covers parts from both halves of the orange? Illustrate with a figure.

**Answers:**



---

**Question 4**: What needs to be changed in the parameters to get suitable superpixels for the tiger images as well? 

**Answers:**



---

**Question 5**: How do the results change depending on the bandwidths? What settings did you prefer for the different images? Illustrate with an example image with the parameter that you think are suitable for that image. 

**Answers:**



---

**Question 6**: What kind of similarities and differences do you see between K-means and mean-shift segmentation? 

**Answers:**



---

**Question 7**: Does the ideal parameter setting vary depending on the images? If you look at the images, can you see a reason why the ideal settings might differ? Illustrate with an example image with the parameters you prefer for that image.

**Answers:**



---

**Question 8**: Which parameter(s) was most effective for reducing the subdivision and still result in a satisfactory segmentation? 

**Answers:**



---

**Question 9**: Why does Normalized Cut prefer cuts of approximately equal size? Does this happen in practice? 

**Answers:**



----

**Question 10**: Did you manage to increase *radius* and how did it affect the results? 

**Answers:**



---

**Question 11**: Does the ideal choice of *alpha* and *sigma* vary a lot between different images? Illustrate with an example image with the parameters you prefer.

**Answers:**



---

**Question 12**: How much can you lower K until the results get considerably worse? 

**Answers:**

 

---

**Question 13**: Unlike the earlier method Graph Cut segmentation relies on some input from a user for defining a rectangle. Is the benefit you get of this worth the effort? Motivate! 

**Answers:**



---

**Question 14**: What are the key differences and similarities between the segmentation methods (K-means, Mean-shift, Normalized Cut and energy-based segmentation with Graph Cuts) in this lab? Think carefully!! 

**Answers:**
