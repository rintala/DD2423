**Question 4**: What can you observe? Provide explanation based on the generated images. 

 

Answers:

 

___________________________________________________________________________

 

**Question 5**: Assemble the results of the experiment above into an illustrative collage with the *subplot* command. Which are your observations and conclusions? 

 

Answers:

**Question 7**: Present your best results obtained with *extractedge* for *house* and *tools*. 

 

Answers:

**Question 9**: How do the results and computational time depend on the number of cells in the accumulator? 

 

Answers:

 

___________________________________________________________________________

 

**Question 10**: How do you propose to do this? Try out a function that you would suggest and see if it improves the results. Does it?
